## Logistic Regression Model
Logistic regression is a statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression).It models the probability of the classes from target variable. 
These probability predictions will be transformed into binary values (0 or 1) so that the appropriate classes can be obtained as output of the model.
